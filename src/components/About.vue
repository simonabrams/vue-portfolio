        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="body-copy">I'm an interactive developer with about 20 years of advertising industry experience. I've worked for some of the cream of the crop agencies (Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Deutsch, Droga5), and I've created web sites and ads for clients and brands like Tylenol, Microsoft, Hennessy, Chase, Prudential, Google and countless others. Here's some of my recent interactive advertising work.</p>
